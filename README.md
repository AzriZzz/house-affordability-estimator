# House Affordability Estimator

A simple calculator to help estimate how much house you can afford based on your salary and current debt obligations.

## How It Works

The calculator uses the following rules to determine your maximum house purchase price:

### 1. Based on Debt-to-Income Ratio
- No existing debt: Up to 5x annual salary
- Debt < 20% of monthly salary: Up to 4x annual salary
- Debt > 20% of monthly salary: Up to 3x annual salary

### 2. Key Considerations
- Monthly mortgage payments should not exceed 30% of monthly income
- 10% down payment is recommended
- Monthly installment estimates include:
  - No debt: RM1,300-1,500 per RM300,000 loan
  - Low debt: RM1,000-1,200 per RM240,000 loan
  - High debt: RM700-900 per RM180,000 loan

### 3. Additional Financial Factors
Remember to account for:
- Property maintenance
- Utility bills
- Transportation costs
- Food expenses
- Family expenses
- Renovation savings
- Furniture and appliances

## Important Notes
- Calculate based on current financial situation, not projected future income
- Consider setting aside savings for renovation and furnishing
- Verify actual loan eligibility with banks/agents
- Monthly commitment is a long-term obligation

## Disclaimer
This is a general guideline only. Actual loan approval and terms depend on various factors including credit score, employment stability, and specific bank requirements.
